For me the title says it all but if you still need to be convinced, first of all catch up on [Eight Ways Digital Twins Can Action Real Change](https://medium.com/digitalx/5-ways-digital-twins-can-action-real-change-4115f5000f76) and [Why you need to invest in heroes to build Digital Twins](https://medium.com/digitalx/why-you-need-to-invest-in-heroes-to-build-digital-twins-9d08b85304cf), then read on.

Outsource, outsource, outsource — except when you don’t need too. There are plenty of things that partners and platforms can help with — they should be the things that don’t differentiate you from the rest or are commodity items that speed up your ability to execute. But Digital Twins are different, do them right and they will be at the core of your business and take your operations to the next level.

It’s for this reason that your focus on implementing Digital Twins should be 100% percent focused on what makes your different. Don’t teach others your secret sauce. Relentless review, embed and continuously improve your business knowledge and your business will reap the benefits.

Don’t get distracted by quick wins/repeatable problems others have already solved — build on the shoulders of giants and your Digital Twins will be everything you hoped for and more.
